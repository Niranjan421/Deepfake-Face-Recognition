## About The Project
Deepfake Recognition is a machine learning project designed to detect and classify deepfake media content. Leveraging advanced computer vision and deep learning techniques, this project aims to identify manipulated video and image content, enhancing the ability to distinguish between real and synthetic media.

# Key Features:
* Deepfake Detection: Employs state-of-the-art algorithms to analyze and detect deepfakes with high accuracy.
* Multi-Model Approach: Utilizes various neural network architectures and pre-trained models for robust detection capabilities.
* Real-Time Analysis: Provides real-time evaluation of video frames and images to identify potential deepfakes.
* User-Friendly Interface: Includes an intuitive interface for easy interaction and result interpretation. :smile:

# Installation
To install it, download all the files in a ZIP format, check the image location according to your device, and then click on the main.py file to run it,your site will be up and running.

To deploy this project run:
```bash
pip install streamlit
```
```bash
  streamlit run app.py
```
[NOTE: The trained model has not been uploaded due to GitHub's file size restriction, which limits uploads to files smaller than 25MB.]
